Note Taker Application by Terry Kim

This server.js file will utilize the html files via starter code to create a note taking app. The note taking app will allow user to input a title and a body for the note taking purpose.
 The option of using Heroku or just LocalHost will work. In this case, Heroku was used as the final uploaded application.

-The user will be able to input a title.

-The user will be able to fill out the body for note taking purposes.

-The user keeps any notes saved. 

-The user can delete any notes.
